So, let me introduce myself a bit, my...

As you can see, I am pretty enthusiastic about open source which driven me to work on many projects. I love building tools, and figuring out solutions to the problems I encounter. For example, the slides you are looking at are powered by Slidev, a markdown-based presentation tool that is built on top of Web technologies. It was born when I found the existing tools were not flexible enough for me to present my code.

Similarly, when I looked into ESLint and its ecosystem a few months ago, I found many things are interesting with a lot potential by not yet fully explored. So today, I'd like to share with you some of my findings and practices during my recent exploration around it.

<!--
In case you have never heard about it or haven't dig into the docs yet. Here, let me make a quick comparison between the legacy eslintrc config [click] and the new flat config for you. [click]

To differentiate between those two configuration formats is rather straightforward. [click] The legacy config is named with `.eslintrc` that supports various extensions which might also read from your `package.json`. The flat config, on the other hand, would only be loaded from `eslint.config.js`, a JavaScript config file as the single source of truth.

[click] When it comes to reusing the shared config, the legacy config format implicitly uses the conventional-based `extends` property to load that config from your local `node_modules`. You would need to learn the convention a little bit to know how it resolves. While in the flat config we use the native import, where it's more explicit, and gives a lot more controls to you.

[click] For plugins, it used to take an array of strings, which is again, convention-based and coupled with the plugins' package name. Now in the flat config, it takes a named object for plugins. This means you can now rename plugins easily, or switch to a fork without being forced to change every rule in your config.

[click] Also, the inheritance nature of `extends` might result in a very complex tree structure as the shared configs can also have nested `extends` inside. In the flat config, it gets simplified a lot, where you explicitly import the shared configs as multiple objects or arrays, and compose them into a single flat one.

## Flat Config

<Timeline mt2 />

<v-clicks>

- RFC was created at January 2019
- Experimental in `v8.21.0`
- Stable in `v8.45.0`
- Default in `v9.0.0`
- JavaScript config with full control
- Simplified inheritance and overriding
- Flexible, Dynamic, Customizable

</v-clicks>

<!--
[click] For a little bit more context, Here is a graph I drew to demonstrate the timeline. While the flat config might sound new to some of you, it has actually been planned for 5 years already. [click] The RFC was created in January 2019, [click] first implementation available in v8.21.0 as experimental, which was two years ago.  [click] It became stable in v8.45.0, [click] and then became the default recently in v9.0.0. In between, the ESLint team has published multiple blog posts to explain the reasons why they want to introduce the new format, and shared the roadmap of rolling out. That's a lot of effort spent across this 5 years plan - huge respect to the ESLint team.

So, as we mentioned in the previous slide, [click] the biggest benefit of flat config, is that now it's in JS where you have full control. [click] It uses native import to resolve the plugins and configs, making the inheritance and overriding a lot simplified. [click] Because it's fully in JavaScript, shared configs can be factory functions that take users' options; and users can have a lot more capability to do the customizations towards their specific needs.

Before we talk about the new exciting stuff, let me first quickly go through the tools for migrating your legacy config to the new flat config, in case you might need them.

I would recommend you check the ESLint docs and migration guide for more detailed instructions.

<div w="40%">

## Config Inspector <sup text-purple bg-purple:15 px1.5 rounded text-sm>Official</sup>

<div mt-4 />
<v-click>

```bash
eslint --inspect-config
```

</v-click>
<div mt-4 />

<v-clicks>

- Visualize your config
- Understand the composition
- In-place documentations

</div>

<!--
The first one is the ESLint Config Inspector - a visualized DevTools, that allows you to inspect and play with your final resolved configs.

[click] You can try it by running `eslint --inspect-config` in your CLI under the project root where you have the flat config file, and it will open a browser page with UI, like the one you see on the right.

[click] So, the first thing it does is to render each config item you have. You can see all configs listed here, because it's flat. Here I have a rather complex config setup with many config items. But with the name provided by each config, you can easily see and understand the purpose for each of them.

[click] You can also expand each item to see how it contributes to the final config, like how many rules enabled, or what's their target file types, etc.

[click] In each rule, you can also see their options, a short description, and also, a link to their documentation page.

[click] Since in ESLint, you can have different rule sets that apply to different file types or are more granular to their exact file path. In the config inspector, you can also enter the file path to test how rules are enabled for that file.

In another tab, you can also browse each rule available, given the plugins you have installed. You can filter them and see which rules you are using, which rules you don't, which are recommended ones, and which are deprecated.

[click] Here I have my config file as an example. The config is a factory function that takes some rather high-level options. With the config inspector, we could see how it was resolved based on the options we provided. We could also try to change the options and see how it affects the result. For example, I could also provide it the path of my tsconfig, which will enable the type-aware rules for me automatically.

    files: ['*.vue'],
    ...vue.configs['vue3-recommand'],
    rules: {
      ...vue.configs['vue3-recommand'].rules,
      'vue/html-indent': ['error', 2]

    rules: {
      'vue/html-indent': ['error', 2]
    }
  })
```

</div>
</div>

<!--
To make config customization easier, I also made a small library called `eslint-flat-config-utils`.

[click] For example, here is a flat config we might have. Depending on how each shared config is constructed, some might be a plain config object, some might be an array, and some might be a constructor that returns an object, an array or even a Promise. When you use them together, it's usually your responsibility to join them together as a single array.

[click] With the config utils, [click] I made a utility function called `compose`, [click] which will automatically resolve the different types of configs, resolve the promise and merge them together.

[click] It also provides some chainable actions where you could insert extra configs anywhere you want, or override some config without the need to handle the merge manually.

</div>
</div>

</div>

<!--
Here we can do a quick comparison to show what I mean.

[click] In the new flat config, a shared config can be a factory function that takes user options, which we couldn't do in the legacy config. Imagine if I want my config to work in both TypeScript and non-TypeScript projects, Vue and non-Vue projects, I will need to do a monorepo to publish configs for different combinations. As you can see, it doesn't scale well, we are doubling the amount of combinations for each option.

[click] The flat config allows you to provide semantic options to toggle each feature dynamically. Making one single config able to adapt to different projects.

[click] Because of that, we could also have high-level abstraction to absorb the underlying complexity, and provide a minimal configuration interface like Prettier, where end users don't even need to worry about the underlying details, [click] but still have all the control to do so when they really want to.

```

</div>
</div>

<!--
Flat config also makes it possible for meta-frameworks to provide project-aware configs.

[click] For example, in Nuxt, we have file-based routing, auto-imported components, server API directories, etc. Files under different folders or different names might have different purposes and different constraints.

So in Nuxt we had the Nuxt ESLint module [click] that generates a sub ESLint config file based on the user's project setup. Where users can extend from and keep adding their custom rules.

This is just one direction of the possibilities with flat config we are currently exploring, but we believe there would be many more interesting approaches coming from the community.

<!--
The is that ESLint can be a [click] Formatter.

This is certainly not new, as many projects have been using ESLint that way since the very beginning.

While this topic is actually a bit controversial, which you might hear people saying you should use a dedicated formatter like Prettier or dprint. To me, I see this all down to that those stylistic rules for ESLint take a lot of maintenance effort. Last year, ESLint and the TypeScript ESLint teams decided to deprecate those stylistic rules from the core. [click] And then, I initiated the ESLint Stylistic project, gathering all those stylistic rules for JS, TS, and JSX into this organization and making a community keep maintaining them. I keep using ESLint as formatter as I see it much more flexible and customizable than Prettier due to ESLint's nature.

[click] If you are using VS Code, you can see `editor.codeActionOnSave` to auto-fix eslint errors on save. And use `eslint.rules.customizations` to silent stylistic rules in your IDE so they work more like a formatter. For other code editors, I believe there are similar configs for doing the same.

<!--
One ESLint rule is essential a function that takes the code and AST, reporting errors with optional fix information.

This means that ESLint can also be a nice tool for [click] codemod.

For example, [click] I made `eslint-plugin-command` to do on-demand micro-codemod.

As you can see in the video, we could put a magic comment saying `to-function` right above an arrow function. Upon saving, the arrow function will be automatically converted into the function declaration, without you to manually move things around.

Similarly, you can also convert it back with `to-arrow`, sort an object or array with `keep-sorted`, make sure an array is unique with `keep-unique`... etc.

If you learn a little bit about AST, it shouldn't be hard to write your one-off codemod rules to migrate your codebase as well.

</v-click>

<!--
And finally, I'd like to mention that ESLint can also [click] lint for many other languages other than JavaScript.

[click] For example, we know we have `@typescript-eslint` to make ESLint understand TypeScript.

[click] We have `eslint-plugin-vue` for Vue Single file component, [click] `eslint-plugin-svelte` for Svelte component [click] and `eslint-plugin-astro` for Astro.

[click] We could also have `eslint-plugin-jsonc` to lint JSON files. Which could be very handle to be used to sort certain field in certain JSON files. For example, I use it to keep my dependencies list in my `package.json` always sorted.

[click] Similarly, we have the support for YAML and [click] TOML files. As you can see, many of those plugins are maintained by Ota Meshi - he is truly amazing!

[click] Then we have `graphql-eslint` for GraphQL by Dima, [click] `html-eslint` for HTML by Yeon Juan [click], and `eslint-mdx` by Joun Qin.

[click] I also made a `eslint-plugin-format` to use Prettier or dprint to format files like CSS that are not yet have an ESLint integration.

That's only a few I could list here. [click] You can also check the ESLint's RFC #99, where they are trying to make ESLint more language agnostic to support the linting for more languages easier.

# One for All{.important-text-3em}

<!--
To summarize today's topic, I'd like to say that ESLint makes it possible to be One for All in two aspects. That you can have one config for all projects, and then one tool for everything related to code checking and modifications.

If you want to learn more, you can check my personal ESLint config, where I used all the tricks I mentioned today.

I am honestly a bit flattered to see that even tho I didn't intend to have this config used by the others, it ends up being quite popular to have 3 thousand stars and over 30 thousand projects using it on GitHub.

[click] I wasn't trying to make you use my config, but hopefully, it can be a good reference for you to build your own shared config that is both powerful and flexible.
